 * BOILERPLATE — no koans written yet. The brief is below; delete it as you write them.

 *
 * ── WHAT A MODELING KOAN IS, AND IS NOT ──────────────────────────────────
 * A SQL koan blanks a token inside a query and checks the RESULT. A modeling koan is the
 * other way round: the ORACLE is what the schema refuses, and what real data does when you
 * try to load it into it.
 *
 * Do NOT ask the learner to type CREATE TABLE here. If a koan says "write the schema", their
 * effort goes into DDL syntax, which is not the subject. Only the project rung authors a
 * whole model. See SchemaKoanBase for the five rungs and the helper each one uses.
 *
 * THIS LESSON'S RUNGS: koan:diagnose
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EPISODE, SPECIFICALLY ───────────────────────────────────────
 * GOAL: answer a question as of a date in the past.
 * MODELS: effective dating, valid_from/valid_to, history tables, point-in-time queries.
 *
 * Business time, not system time. Both are needed and they are different axes — if a
 * soft-delete/audit-column episode is ever added, it is the system-time half, and bitemporal
 * is the pair.
 * NORTHWIND CARRIES THE DEMONSTRATION: "Order Details"."UnitPrice" is duplicated from
 * "Products"."UnitPrice", which reads as sloppy denormalization until you see it is price
 * history — you must record what you CHARGED, not what you charge.
 * The shipped rows do not show it (verified: 0 of 193 differ). DO NOT SEED A DIFFERENCE.
 * Have the learner UPDATE a product price in their own practice schema and watch the
 * historical line hold. Better lesson, needs no dataset change, and it is hands-on.
 * Boundary: Data Model Patterns owns Effective Dating as a pattern. Here it is the technique.
 *
 * ── THE RULE THAT KEEPS THESE HONEST ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Pair every shouldReject with a shouldAccept. A learner who only ever sees rejections
 * learns to bolt constraints onto everything and call it rigour; the pincer — this must
 * bounce, AND this must still get through — is the judgement actually being taught.

 * ║  SCHEMA KOANS — Data Modeling · Series 2 · 10 Surrogate vs Natural Keys
 * ╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
 *
 * BOILERPLATE — no koans written yet. The brief is below; delete it as you write them.

 *     ./zeus.sh koans datamodeling series2 _10    (macOS/Linux)
 *
 * ── WHAT A MODELING KOAN IS, AND IS NOT ──────────────────────────────────
 * A SQL koan blanks a token inside a query and checks the RESULT. A modeling koan is the
 * other way round: the ORACLE is what the schema refuses, and what real data does when you
 * try to load it into it.
 *
 * Do NOT ask the learner to type CREATE TABLE here. If a koan says "write the schema", their
 * effort goes into DDL syntax, which is not the subject. Only the project rung authors a
 * whole model. See SchemaKoanBase for the five rungs and the helper each one uses.
 *
 * THIS LESSON'S RUNGS: koan:choose, koan:predict
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EPISODE, SPECIFICALLY ───────────────────────────────────────
 * GOAL: choose a key that survives the business changing its mind.
 * MODELS: surrogate vs natural keys, identity/sequence, why ISBN betrays you.
 *
 * ISBN is the trap, and the library domain was chosen partly for it: it looks like a flawless
 * natural key until reissues get new ones, ISBN-10 meets ISBN-13, and a self-published title
 * has none at all.
 * This is also where TITLE vs COPY detonates. 'How many copies of Dune do we own?' and 'who
 * has copy #3?' cannot be answered by the one-book-table model from episode 05. That is the
 * best aha in introductory modeling and it should land here, on their own schema.
 *
 * ── THE RULE THAT KEEPS THESE HONEST ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Pair every shouldReject with a shouldAccept. A learner who only ever sees rejections
 * learns to bolt constraints onto everything and call it rigour; the pincer — this must
 * bounce, AND this must still get through — is the judgement actually being taught.

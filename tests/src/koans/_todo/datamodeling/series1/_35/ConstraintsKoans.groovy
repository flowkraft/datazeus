 *
 * ── WHAT A MODELING KOAN IS, AND IS NOT ──────────────────────────────────
 * A SQL koan blanks a token inside a query and checks the RESULT. A modeling koan is the
 * other way round: the ORACLE is what the schema refuses, and what real data does when you
 * try to load it into it.
 *
 * Do NOT ask the learner to type CREATE TABLE here. If a koan says "write the schema", their
 * effort goes into DDL syntax, which is not the subject. Only the project rung authors a
 * whole model. See SchemaKoanBase for the five rungs and the helper each one uses.
 *
 * THIS LESSON'S RUNGS: koan:predict, koan:complete
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EPISODE, SPECIFICALLY ───────────────────────────────────────
 * GOAL: write down the rules and let the database enforce them.
 * MODELS: NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT.
 *
 * PROOF, verified: NOT NULL on "Region" is REJECTED by the real Customers rows, because
 * Region is genuinely optional. CHECK("UnitPrice" > 10) is REJECTED because a 4.50 product
 * exists. The learner discovers optionality and real bounds FROM THE DATA rather than being
 * told — and learns that a constraint which does not match reality is a bug, not rigour.
 * Always pair a shouldReject koan with a shouldAccept one, or they will over-constrain.
 *
 * ── THE RULE THAT KEEPS THESE HONEST ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Pair every shouldReject with a shouldAccept. A learner who only ever sees rejections
 * learns to bolt constraints onto everything and call it rigour; the pincer — this must
 * bounce, AND this must still get through — is the judgement actually being taught.

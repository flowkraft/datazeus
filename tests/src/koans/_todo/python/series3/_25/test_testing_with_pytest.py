pytest — Testing the Transform Without a Database

TODO — NOT A KOAN YET. Lives under src/koans/_todo/, which the runner does not mount and zeus
does not see, so it cannot mislead anyone into thinking the exercise exists. MOVE IT into
src/koans/python/series3/_25/ when it is real.

    zeus.bat koans python series3 _25     (Windows)
    ./zeus.sh koans python series3 _25    (macOS/Linux)

── READ THESE FIRST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  conftest.py                              the ___ blank, fixtures, and the rules
  series1/_15/test_files_and_encodings.py  worked example: the messy-CSV dataset
  series1/_35/test_merge_and_join.py       worked example: the join fan-out counter

── THE RULES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 1. THE BLANK IS A DATA DECISION, NEVER A LANGUAGE FACT. This matters more here than on any
    other track, because Python Koans (gregmalcolm/python_koans) is a famous LANGUAGE tutorial
    and a reader who has met it will expect `assert 1 + 1 == ___`. That is not what these
    are. The reader here can already PROGRAM — in SQL, in Excel formulas, in a bit of Java —
    and is learning Python as a tool rather than as a first language. Series 1 · 05 and · 10
    do teach the language, fast and on data; even there the blank is what the DATA did, never
    what the syntax means. If a blank can be answered from the docs instead of from the data,
    it is the wrong blank.
 2. NEVER ASSERT WALL-CLOCK TIME. Every performance lesson has a countable proxy that is also
    the lesson. If you think you need a stopwatch, you need a counter.
 3. ONE MECHANISM, only the assertion target changes: a value, a counter, captured output, or
    a process result. There is no second framework and there should never be one.
 4. Use the SAME Northwind numbers the SQL and JVM koans use wherever the topic allows it.

THIS LESSON'S RUNGS: koan:author
DATASET: northwind

── WHY THIS EPISODE, SPECIFICALLY ──────────────────────────────────────
GOAL: know what is worth testing in a data job, and write those tests.
LIBRARIES: pytest, fixtures, parametrize, tmp_path, and DuckDB as a real database in a test.
The honest scope: transforms and parsing are worth testing; a thin driver wrapper mostly is not.
Saying which is which IS the episode.
Nice symmetry worth naming: the reader has been RUNNING pytest since koan one. Now they write it.

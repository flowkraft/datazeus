Loops, Conditionals & Functions — Doing the Same Work Over Many Rows

TODO — NOT A KOAN YET. Lives under src/koans/_todo/, which the runner does not mount and zeus
does not see, so it cannot mislead anyone into thinking the exercise exists. MOVE IT into
src/koans/python/series1/_10/ when it is real.

    zeus.bat koans python series1 _10     (Windows)
    ./zeus.sh koans python series1 _10    (macOS/Linux)

── READ THESE FIRST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  conftest.py                              the ___ blank, fixtures, and the rules
  series1/_15/test_files_and_encodings.py  worked example: the messy-CSV dataset
  series1/_35/test_merge_and_join.py       worked example: the join fan-out counter

── THE RULES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 1. THE BLANK IS A DATA DECISION, NEVER A LANGUAGE FACT. This matters more here than on any
    other track, because Python Koans (gregmalcolm/python_koans) is a famous LANGUAGE tutorial
    and a reader who has met it will expect `assert 1 + 1 == ___`. That is not what these
    are. The reader here can already PROGRAM — in SQL, in Excel formulas, in a bit of Java —
    and is learning Python as a tool rather than as a first language. Series 1 · 05 and · 10
    do teach the language, fast and on data; even there the blank is what the DATA did, never
    what the syntax means. If a blank can be answered from the docs instead of from the data,
    it is the wrong blank.
 2. NEVER ASSERT WALL-CLOCK TIME. Every performance lesson has a countable proxy that is also
    the lesson. If you think you need a stopwatch, you need a counter.
 3. ONE MECHANISM, only the assertion target changes: a value, a counter, captured output, or
    a process result. There is no second framework and there should never be one.
 4. Use the SAME Northwind numbers the SQL and JVM koans use wherever the topic allows it.

THIS LESSON'S RUNGS: koan:complete, koan:predict
DATASET: none

── WHY THIS EPISODE, SPECIFICALLY ──────────────────────────────────────
GOAL: do the same work over many rows without repeating yourself.
LIBRARIES: for/if, comprehensions, def, and why a function is where a transform belongs.
KOAN (predict): the classic off-by-one on a header row, which silently drops or doubles a record
rather than raising. A wrong count, not an exception — that is the bar for this track.

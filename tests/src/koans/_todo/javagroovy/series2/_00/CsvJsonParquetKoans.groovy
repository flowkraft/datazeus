 *
 * TODO — NOT A KOAN YET. Lives under src/koans/_todo/, which maven does not compile
 * and zeus does not see, so it cannot mislead anyone into thinking the exercise exists.
 * MOVE IT into src/koans/groovy/datazeus/javagroovy/ (same series/episode path) when it is real.
 *
 * Brief below; delete it as you write the koans.
 *
 * ── READ THESE TWO FIRST ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   JvmKoanBase                        the rules, and why they are the rules
 *   series2/_35/BatchingAndTransactionsKoans   the worked example
 *
 * ── THE THREE RULES THAT DECIDE EVERY KOAN HERE ─────────────────────────
 *  1. THE BLANK IS A DATA DECISION, NEVER A LANGUAGE FACT. This reader already knows Java.
 *     A koan that teaches map() insults them; one that hands them a wrong number does not.
 *  2. NEVER ASSERT WALL-CLOCK TIME. Every performance lesson here has a countable proxy that
 *     is also the actual lesson. If you think you need a stopwatch, you need a counter.
 *  3. ONE MECHANISM, ONLY THE ASSERTION TARGET CHANGES — a value, a counter, captured output,
 *     or a process result. There is no second framework and there should never be one.
 *
 * THIS LESSON'S RUNGS: koan:complete
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EPISODE, SPECIFICALLY ──────────────────────────────────────
 * GOAL: read the three formats a data job actually meets, and know when each is right.
 * CONSTRUCTS: commons-csv or opencsv, Jackson ObjectMapper/readTree, parquet via DuckDB or
 * parquet-avro. Streaming vs whole-file for each.
 * Say plainly what each format is FOR: CSV is what you are sent, JSON is what APIs return,
 * Parquet is what analytics stores. That framing is the episode.

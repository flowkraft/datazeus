 *
 * CTEs (WITH) — Breaking a Long Query Into Named Steps
 *
 * TODO — NOT A KOAN YET. Lives under src/koans/_todo/, which maven does not compile and zeus
 * does not see, so it cannot mislead anyone into thinking the exercise exists. MOVE IT into
 * src/koans/groovy/datazeus/learnsql/series2/_08/ when it is real.

 * ── READ THESE FIRST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   KoanBase                                  shouldReturn, the ___ blank, the dataset
 *   learnsql/series1/_10/WhereFilteringKoans   the worked example: twelve koans, one per idea
 *
 * ── THE RULES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  1. THE BLANK GOES INSIDE THE SQL. The learner WRITES THE QUERY; the koan checks the
 *     RESULT. You learn SQL by writing queries, not by typing in a number.
 *  2. ONE KOAN PER IDEA IN THE LESSON, IN THE LESSON'S ORDER. The koans are a parallel set of
 *     drills, not a blanked copy of the gate in src/verify.
 *  3. PREDICT FIRST. Word each koan so the reader can say the answer out loud before running
 *     it — that is the skill, and the hint shows returned-vs-expected so they fix the SQL
 *     rather than guess a number.
 *  4. END WITH A WHOLE-QUERY KOAN. A row-set expectation is fake-resistant in a way a single
 *     count is not.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EPISODE, SPECIFICALLY ──────────────────────────────────────
 * GOAL: break a query you cannot read into steps you can.
 * SQL: WITH, multiple CTEs, referencing one from the next.
 * MOVED UP FROM SERIES 3 in the 2026-08-24 pass. A CTE is a READABILITY tool, not an advanced
 * feature, and holding it back meant every query in this series got written as a nested subquery
 * the reader would later have to unlearn. From here on, everything uses WITH.
 * The motivation is free at this point: the pre-aggregating subquery from episode 06 works and is
 * unreadable. "Name it, then use the name" is the whole lesson.

 * ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
 *
 * Cohorts & Repeat-Purchase Analysis — Measuring Who Comes Back, and When
 *
 * TODO — NOT A KOAN YET. Lives under src/koans/_todo/, which maven does not compile and zeus
 * does not see, so it cannot mislead anyone into thinking the exercise exists. MOVE IT into
 * src/koans/groovy/datazeus/learnsql/series3/_10/ when it is real.
 *

 *     ./zeus.sh koans learnsql series3 _10    (macOS/Linux)
 *
 * ── READ THESE FIRST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   KoanBase                                  shouldReturn, the ___ blank, the dataset
 *   learnsql/series1/_10/WhereFilteringKoans   the worked example: twelve koans, one per idea
 *
 * ── THE RULES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  1. THE BLANK GOES INSIDE THE SQL. The learner WRITES THE QUERY; the koan checks the
 *     RESULT. You learn SQL by writing queries, not by typing in a number.
 *  2. ONE KOAN PER IDEA IN THE LESSON, IN THE LESSON'S ORDER. The koans are a parallel set of
 *     drills, not a blanked copy of the gate in src/verify.
 *  3. PREDICT FIRST. Word each koan so the reader can say the answer out loud before running
 *     it — that is the skill, and the hint shows returned-vs-expected so they fix the SQL
 *     rather than guess a number.
 *  4. END WITH A WHOLE-QUERY KOAN. A row-set expectation is fake-resistant in a way a single
 *     count is not.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EPISODE, SPECIFICALLY ──────────────────────────────────────
 * GOAL: answer "who comes back?" — the analysis everything so far was for.
 * SQL: nothing new; CTEs, windows, date_trunc and joins doing real work together.
 * The one episode in Series 3 that is an ANALYSIS PATTERN rather than a SQL feature, and the
 * strongest "so this is what it was all for" moment in the course. Keep it that way.
